# ILAZYSELL CAROUSELL EXTENSION

Click-Chatting to Save Your Sanity

I got tired of typing the same replies on Carousell, so I made an extension that doesn't inject scripts or scrape servers. Now, I just highlight keywords, get instant response suggestions, and tweak the tone with a slider (Friendly, Neutral, or "Damn CB") based on how the conversatzion is going. I can also manage my own keyword-based responses and reply with one click. Itâ€™s simple, I save time and my sanity.

âœ… Instant Replies â€“ Highlight keywords to fetch smart responses
ðŸŽ­ Tone Selector â€“ Adjust replies to match your mood
ðŸ“‚ Keyword Manager â€“ Store, edit & manage custom responses
ðŸ”— One-Click Copy â€“ Send messages faster than everz
