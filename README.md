# ILAZYSELL CAROUSELL EXTENSION

Click-Chatting to Save Your Sanity

I got tired of repeating replies on Carousell, so I made an extension that skips scraping and scripts. Now, I just highlight keywords, get instant suggestions, and adjust the tone (Friendly, Neutral, or "Damn CB") with a slider. I can also manage my own responses and reply with one click. Simple, fast, and sanity-saving.

âœ… Instant Replies â€“ Highlight keywords to fetch smart responses

ðŸŽ­ Tone Selector â€“ Adjust replies to match your mood

ðŸ“‚ Keyword Manager â€“ Store, edit & manage custom responses

ðŸ”— One-Click Copy â€“ Send messages faster than ever
